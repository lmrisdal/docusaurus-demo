Creating code to connect to different cloud services like blob and ServiceBus or protocol like SFTP and email is one of the most time consuming and redundant programming challenges that face a lot of software development teams within integration. To mitigate the mind-numbing boredom of tackling this challenge, CX offers adapters that have been built and added to over long periods of time to cover even the strangest edge cases of file transfer. The adapters are also continually developed as times and technology changes and comes with a set of logging options that ensure traceability even on very simple integration scenarios.
