This means that the receiving recruitment tool can't know if a user has been deleted or not without cleaning out all entries that are not received by CX. If we choose to make the recruitment system delete all non-received events we can potentially delete users that fail or are delayed for some reason either in the User Api or in CX itself. This can cause users to loose access or loss of system specific settings created in the recruitment Api relating to the user. To solve this problem we want CX to remember what users were sent last time and, instead of not sending information about deleted users, we make CX actively send delete messages for the deleted users. If your receiving Api does not support delete events or similar mechanisms you can use the ",(0,i.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"/Adapters/Outbound/Acknowledgment"},"acknowledgements")," functionality in tandem with alerting on log events to handle failures manually or automatically in the receiving system.
