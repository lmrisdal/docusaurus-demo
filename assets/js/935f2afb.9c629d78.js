This page describes how CX handles encoding and potential pitfalls.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"functionality":{"id":"functionality","title":"Functionality","description":"We categorize functionality in CX by two states; in development and production ready.

Using the endpoints provided by said Api will let you perform CRUD operations on integrations. By incorporating calls to the Management Api in CI/CD pipelines you can curate your transformations and integrations from within your own version control or DevOps system. The Api is hosted next to the Messaging Api and the swagger is found here:  This page explains the technical details around the Api and contains examples of how to call and authorize towards it.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"metadata":{"id":"metadata","title":"Metadata","description":"When the pipeline instance is created within CX upon data entering through an adapter, a context is implicitly created with the message. This context describes what type of message and what type of transformations said message will experience through CX. All of this information is compiled into an object we have called metadata which follows the message on its journey through the CX pipeline. The metadata object is used for various purposes internally in CX and it\'s also possible make CX include the object in log events. For Archeo we have a separate system for metadata that is displayed in its own section of the archeo log (see Archeo for further information), for other logging providers the metadata is included in the JSON as its own object.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"overview":{"id":"overview","title":"Overview","description":"- What is ConnXio?","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"resending":{"id":"resending","title":"Resending","description":"Resending in ConnXio (CX) functions differently based upon the event type you react to.

We do this by creating a bucket where messages are queued for a set interval until they are picked up, run through a code mapping and then sent as a single message through the pipeline. There are certain limits to batching functionality that will be explained on this page as well the process of batching itself.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Transformation/code-components":{"id":"Transformation/code-components","title":"Code Components","description":"ConnXio (CX) uses C# code to transform data at multiple points through the CX pipeline.
